# Tilting Text Entry on the BBC Mircobit by Neil Rickus @computingchamps
# Version 1.0 released 16th Feb 2016
#
# Program uses the BBC Microbit's accelerometer to allow the entry of text, which can subsequently scroll across the screen
# View the program in action here - Youtube link
#
# Tilt the Microbit right to move up through the alphabet, or left to move down through the alphabet
# Spaces for separating letters / words can be found at the start and the end of the alphabet
#
# Press button A when the letter (or space) you want to enter is displayed. A happy face will acknowledge the button press
#
# On your final letter, hold (not press) button A to add the letter, then press button B to finish entering text
# A heart will acknowledge the button press and your text will scroll across the display continuously
#
# Possible enhancements:
# - Tilting the device further left or right increases the speed the letters are displayed
# - Button B can be used to add spaces, with buttons A and B together completing text entry
# - Add audio acknowledgements on button press
# - While text is scrolling, the A / B buttons could slow down / speed up the scrolling rate
# - Allow emojis to be entered
# - The entered text could be sent out via email or Twitter (maybe!)
